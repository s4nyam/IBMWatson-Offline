Hello sir,
Now I am going to present a short demo for our project,
Since we are remote interns we are lacking to present ou a live demo though I have made a small video for same..
Please see this till end,,

Thanks..

So lets first see the requirements to setup python SDK for Watson API..
here it goes

First thing first,... 
The requiremrnt to setup Pythonsdk for watson API...


These requirements can be easily installed using pip Module whether on windows or unix.. It can be these can be installed by simple command sudo pip install -r requiremnts.txt

After installing these requs. we can run our environment for watson...


So i have already installed requirements..
Lets move to code..


#the username and psswd are fetched from bluemix console...


once u get this lets move forward to next steps...
sorry the video is taking more time.. ;)




Each logic is made under rigorous learning of documentation..

We had been reading docs all the time and finally came to this api implementation...

These recording files are the files which are sample input audio files which have small audio which will be going to converted to text by our agent/program..


lets listen to the audio file..


So first audio is about tornadoes hitting and second one was also related to news..

So this will be going to converted...

 lets see the command usage...



See how easy is to convert this..

This have many real life applications


One major is youtube speech to text when you use realtime auto caption mode or imagine an app that takes down the lecture of a prof. and converts it to its transcript or subtitles for the video...



Thanks for watching the video...





Yours sincerely Sanyam Jain
