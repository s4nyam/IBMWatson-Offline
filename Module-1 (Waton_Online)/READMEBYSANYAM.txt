TO RUN ON TERMINAL  :	

python ./sttClient.py -credentials 3f5ee88f-5e50-4fb2-ac2a-17f63e7edcd5:oAEBOklXSuPl -model en-US_BroadbandModel

this is the command usage


first : Python to initiate python proram
second  : ./sttClient.py  the file we need to run put as argument..

third arguement : -credentials   Credentials flag is for making our code undersatnd that we are entering credntials and to invokde that particular function...

fourth arguement : 
 This is username from bluemix console		3f5ee88f-5e50-4fb2-ac2a-17f63e7edcd5:

oAEBOklXSuPl  this is password...



CREDENTIALS:

oAEBOklXSuPl
3f5ee88f-5e50-4fb2-ac2a-17f63e7edcd5


so we have started our program and its running..
The program takes time according to ur internet speed as well as bluemix usage..


So all the ten files are getting parsed with Speech to Text client..

These are expected to have high accuracy as these are going online method on watson..







yeahh,,,,

we are done with conversion... 

Lets check the output and match with the audio file again....
