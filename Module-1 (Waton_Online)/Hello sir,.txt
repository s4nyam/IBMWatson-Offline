Hello sir,
Now I am going to present a demo for our project till now we developed.. 

So here it goes...

These are the pre recorded files which we downloaded from internet samples called audio-net  - a database for free and royalty free audio samples...



so these are just sample input files for our project and we are going to take output from thses files recursively using watson API (online)..
also we have used an algorithm to make the voice feature so clear so as it cleans the audio file and removes background noise which have low frequence voice...
So now lets run the code and see the output...


So this is processing period which is time taking,..
It converts the speech files to a json tree and put it in output folder and just completes our result as Speech to text using IBM watson api ONLINE...
So its done...
Now lets see the output...
